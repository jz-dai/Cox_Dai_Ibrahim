# Marine Microplastics Map Portal Data


## Summary
Extracted from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Marine Microplastics Map Portal. This resource serves as a repository for datasets from research cruises and field work conducted by various researchers and institutions from around the world.


## Database Information
22,266 entries of global microplastic data as csv files, stored under Data/NPSG_Microplastics_Raw/NPSG_Marine_Microplastics_WGS84.csv.

Two datasets from the East Pacific (east of 180°) and West Pacific (west of 180°), under the name NPSG_East_Marine_Microplastics_WGS84.csv and NPSG_West_Marine_Microplastics_WGS84.csv respectively.
